# SimianArmy

Based on the ideas by **Netfilx's SimianArmy** (https://github.com/Netfilx/SimianArmy), SimianArmy provides a set of simple tools to help you test the resiliency of your systems.

The army currently consists of these soldiers:

- **Monkey**: It's a random action scheduler. It accepts one or more action files ( **.INI** style formated) describing actions (system commands and event distribution), and it executes those actions at random times. Actions can be defined as reversible, so you can simulate off-on scenarios). Action execution can be logged to a **.BAT** file, so it's easy to reproduce the executed scenarios at will.
- **Wait**: It's a tool to make the system wait a given amout of miliseconds. It helps in reproducing the seuquence of actions generated by **Monkey**.
