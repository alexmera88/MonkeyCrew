# WinSimians

Inspired by **Jeff Atwood**'s post [Working with the Chaos Monkey](https://blog.codinghorror.com/working-with-the-chaos-monkey/), and **Netfilx**'s [SimianArmy](https://github.com/Netfilx/SimianArmy), WinSimians helps you test the resiliency of your Windows(R) systems.

WinSimians is currently based of these tools:

- **Monkey**: It's a random action scheduler. It accepts one or more action files ( **.INI** style formated) describing actions (system commands and event distribution), and it executes those actions at random times. Actions can be defined as reversible, so you can simulate off-on scenarios). Action execution can be logged to a **.BAT** file, so it's easy to reproduce the executed scenarios at will.
- **Wait**: It's a tool to make the system wait a given amout of miliseconds. It helps in reproducing the seuquence of actions generated by **Monkey**.
